 * Shame
 *------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * File used for quick fixes / hacks
 * 
 * 1. If itâ€™s a hack, it goes in shame.css.
 * 
 * 2. Document all hacks fully:
 *    a. What part of the codebase does it relate to?
 *    b. Why was this needed?
 *    c. How does this fix it?
 *    d. How might you fix it properly, given more time?
 * 
 * 3. Do not blame the developer; if they explained why they had to do it then
 *    their reasons are probably (hopefully) valid.
 * 
 * 4. Try and clean _shame.sass up when you have some down time or even better,
 *    get a tech-debt story in which you can dedicate actual sprint time to it.
 *
