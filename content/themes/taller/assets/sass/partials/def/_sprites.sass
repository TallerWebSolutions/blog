 * To fully understand how this file works, you should be familiar with the 
 * concepts of compass sprite generation and magic imports. To read more on 
 * that, please refeer to http://compass-style.org/help/tutorials/spriting/ and 
 * the sections listed above in that page. Also, it will be good to have an
 * understading of Sass placeholders. For that, there is a great article too:

/*
 *----------------------------------------------------------
 * By defaut, using compass' magic imports for sprites will
 * generate class selectors, that can then be extend in
 * order to apply the background image to another selector.
 * The problem here is that each time you import this file
 * to a compiling stylesheet, all the sprite selectors will
 * be output without you probably using them. To solve this
 * problem there should be a way to import sprite selectors
 * as placeholders, so that no style selector will be output
 * unless you acctually extend them.
 * 
 * There is an issue on Compass detailing this problem:
 * https://github.com/chriseppstein/compass/issues/1005
 * 
 * The solution written is this document was proposed to the
 * issue above, as well as better documented in this post at
 * CoderWall: https://coderwall.com/p/si0rlq.
 * 
 * Following below are the steps needed to solve this issue.
 * Keep in mind that you don't necessarilly have to
 * understand this in order to make use of compass sprites,
 * as long as you keep "imports" and "includes" in the
 * places suggested below.
 * 
 *----------------------------------------------------------
 * 1) - Define base selectors:
 *----------------------------------------------------------
 * Defining placeholder bases selectors for each sprite in
 * use will make sure the main sprite selectors, where
 * compass sets the background-image attributes, won't be
 * output. The exemple shown below is for a "icons" sprite.
 */

// $icons-sprite-base-class: "%icons-sprite"

/*
 *----------------------------------------------------------
 * 2) - Import and compile images:
 *----------------------------------------------------------
 * This is the step that acctually tells Compass to compile
 * the images under a directory into a sprite. Usually,
 * this would generate and output a class selector like
 * ".icons-sprite", in our exemple.
 */

// @import "icons/*.png"

/*
 *----------------------------------------------------------
 * 3) - Include custom sprite mixin
 *----------------------------------------------------------
 * Each import as the one made above, will load a "magic"
 * Sass partial, containing all the sprite selectors AND
 * some mixins for common sprite usage. These mixins have to
 * be overwritten in order for them to use placeholder based
 * classes for each image selector. We only keep this mixins
 * in another file and on another partial category directory
 * to keep things in order.
 */

@import mixins/sprites

/*
 *----------------------------------------------------------
 * 4) - Include sprites
 *----------------------------------------------------------
 * There are many ways to include sprites. One of them is to
 * use the dynamic mixin "+all-[SPRITE-NAME]-sprite", created
 * for each imported sprite, to include selectors for all
 * the images contained in a sprite. Usually these selectors
 * would be normal classes; due to the mixin imported above,
 * they are now placeholders. As they are now placeholder,
 * there will be no harm on including them all here, so that
 * to use the sprites the only thing I have to do is to
 * extend these selectors, with no need to include any other
 * mixin on my own selectors.
