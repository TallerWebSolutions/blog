 * Use this file to set color variables & functions.
 * 
 * Before starting to define your color variables, I'll advice you: colors (
 * maybe more then other kind of variables in Sass) can get really trick and 
 * messed up after some time, mostly because then tend to change a lot during 
 * development. To help you make better decisions, I would advice you to read 
 * the followng articles:
